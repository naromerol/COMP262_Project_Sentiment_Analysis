       "8493   my reviews for this have changed a few times but no more when i first got it i liked the sound though it did sound a little cold and digital and this is from someone wanting to record shoegazedreampop which by its nature is full of cold tones reverbchorusdelay shimmering a la cocteau twins chapterhouse lush so at first i thought it was great then the fuse software was even cooler all this customizing the sound though it did sound noisy and needed the compressor to take some of the noise awayafter all of that i finally realized i was trying to ignore the fizzcracklehair its called a few things go to the fender forums and look it up or search it on yahoogooglethe thing happening with this amp i think is a few things fender guitars sound best through it which is silly if you dont own a fender and i dont and refuse to get a squire as that body is so played out i wanted anything but a strat body unless i have a grand to pay for an older one im not going to get a rinky dink one and i would only get one after i got like 5 other dream guitars firstso everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality also playing into a modeling amp is like playing into a computer that may be fine for some younger folks but to a lot of people ive read the complaints i was trying not to realize as i didnt feel like having to pay for shipping to return it but i didand i am so glad i did i almost got a peavey vypyr and i am glad i didnt this amp to be fair is really close to being really cool but that sound problem which i read on fenders own forumwebsite fender acknowledges it exists but does nothing to fix it in future models sorry but thats some big company bsive been reading of people saying it sounds cold and lifeless and all that and tube this and tube that and i was like what music snobs and what have you but i realized that im a music snob i love the music i listen to more than anything and feel like the music i create should have a life to it as well so i returned the mustang 2 and almost got a marshall mg 30 watt cause i wanted an amp with a clean sound that didnt have that crackle sound but thankfully i caught myself before that return as after that it would have been finalthe decision i did make i think will be great for me as id rather start with a good real tone then get the effects i need i kept reading reviews of these teenagers that hadnt played for more than a year or two or so saying throw away your pedals you wont need them and i was going to get pedals but dont need to now thats kind of the danger of these amps they end up making everyone sound the same no matter what tweaking i was doing on the mustang it sounded the same but in a different costumei think this amp and modeling amps are best for beginning guitarists and ive seen some old timers getting an amp for home use after years maybe thats for them but i needed something to record with and practice and get the best most real tone possible so that means tube ampi think if i played this at a gc i wouldnt of gotten it and i just tried to make myself like it\n",

       "9151  the n mini chromatic headstock tuner quickly recognized twelve pitch across a multioctave range of electric bass guitar and mandolin the accidental appear a sharp or flat toggled using the alternate function of the frequency buttonthe tuner view window is slightly larger than a chiclet but brightness and resolution are fine for dimlylit space one thing thats le than ideal is the charcoal color of the tuner itself if youve ever dropped stuff on dark stage you know what i mean id wager the back of most headstock skew to lighter tone than darker so if discretion is what the manufacturer is emphasizing a lighter color may work betterthe note appear red when out of tune their color change to green a a rough marker you then continue fine tuning using the vertical bar that appear on both side of the note theyve gone to length to make the tuner stagefriendly but id much prefer the green color mean fine tuned and done that way i can look from a distance i should only have to bother with the bar if im struggling to home in and in my experience thats the exception rather than the rule and usually caused by new string slack under the bridge pin a slipping tuner etc midlife string tend to stretch and loosen predictably so long a you dont use a lot of altered tuningsthe n is designed to be clipped discretely to your instrument headstock and viewed from the back im a lefty and unlike some other tuner i appreciate the swiveling base that allows me to view the screen rightside upthe viewer doesnt extend far above the headstock surface and felt a bit cramped on my l4 with large new yorkerstyle tuner on headstock with more bare wood like a strat or even my astyle mandolin it wa easier to find a comfortable spot for viewing that didnt obstruct my hand while turning keysat first i didnt like the ratchet clamp that attache to the headstock i could attach the tuner with one hand by squeezing the clamp tight but it felt like i needed two to remove it one to press the release and another to pull the clamp out after a little practice however i found this wasnt the case and the touch required isnt difficult at allthe tuner constructed in a highimpact composite similar to those parachutestyle clamp you see on backpack it feel durable and very unlikely to break although i didnt try stomping on iti wa impressed the battery come uninstalled in a separate small bag the battery door ha a concave slot for easy opening with a pick or a coin the tuner ha an autoshutoff function to preserve battery lifethe power and frequency button are just nib really id prefer they be larger with more surface and a bit of click to them the tuner can be calibrated in integer step from 430 to 450 if 440 doesnt work for youone advantage of a chromatic tuner is you can tune to a chord and arent limited to usually diatonic open string for myself i only use tuner to set the pitch of one string usually the low a for guitar or bass and low g for mandolin in my opinion tuning a fretted instrument completely by open string is only slightly better than tuning it completely with harmonic and neither doe the job well intonation is subject to a bunch of variable string action and thickness neck relief fret condition nut and bridge conditiononce i have a single string to pitch i match fretted and open string unison and octave after a while you learn which combination work best for each instrumenti used to love staring at those pignosesized strobatuners sitting on amp and never faulted a musician who took their time to tune accurately i wish many more did im not quite sure how we went from we tune because we care to im so embarrassed to be standing here tuning i hope no one notice but the n mini headstock tuner questionable design choice and all doe what it say with a minimum of fuss   \n",
